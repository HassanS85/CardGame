# CARD GAME PRJOECT

## STAGE 1:
I have been able to use Java to do the following: 
- Has an ArrayList<Card> for the deckOfCards that contains all 52 cards. This is
created and populated when the game is constructed.
- Has a name which is also defined in the constructor.
- Has a getDeck method that lists out the cards in the deck. 

- Has a String suit. Use the unicode characters of heart, club, diamond and spade.
- Has a String symbol (2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A).
- Has an int value (2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14).
- Has a toString method that describes the class.

## For STAGE 2: 

- Add methods for the CardGame class that allow for the following:
- ArrayList<Card> sortDeckInNumberOrder() - sorts the deck in number order (e.g.
2222333344445555 etc) and stores the new shuffled deck back into the deckOfCards
attribute.
- ArrayList<Card> sortDeckIntoSuits() - sorts the deck into suits (2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A
of hearts, then 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A of clubs etc.) and stores the new shuffled deck
back into the deckOfCards attribute
- ArrayList<Card> shuffleDeck() - shuffles the deck into a random order and stores the
new shuffled deck back into the deckOfCards attribute
